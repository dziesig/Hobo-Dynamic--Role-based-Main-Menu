This is the text of the Hobo Recipe.

This recipe implements a dynamic main menu whose contents are a function of the 
User's Role(s) with each User potentially having both Primary and Secondary Roles.

<bs>
Background:  My daughter is a successful Real Estate Broker here in Florida. 
<brag>She has degrees in Russian, French, Marketing and Computer Science.</brag> 
Together we collaborated on a Back Office Intranet originally implemented in 
Ruby-on-Rails (1.2 if I recall correctly).  The menu system on that website
was hard-coded to allow any given user to choose between two potential modes.
For example, the Broker is also an Agent with different needs for each role.
We had multiple roles:

  Administrator (me)
  Broker (my daughter)
  Reviewer (new for the Hobo version)
  Agent (my daughter plus many others)
  InactiveAgent (few)
  Unassigned (needed as a place holder).
  
The design called for a main menu with the following tabs:

  Home
  ModeSelect (caption is based on user's alternate role)
  Yada 1 (Required place-holder, never visible)
  Yada 2 (Broker-specific)
  *
  Yada 10 (Agent-specific)
  *
  Yada 20 (Reviewer-specific)
  *
  Yada 32 (it's a big site with many functions/data).
  
The admin menu was:

  Home
  Permissions
  Roles
  Users
  
If all of the tabs on the main menu were visible simultaneously, 
there would be no room "above the fold" for application data.  
Also, there are things that the Broker/Administrator can do that 
we didn't want Agents know was possible.

My original Hobo design (or lack thereof) used a hard-coded main menu
that (like its Rails predecessor) was getting very hard to maintain.

I took a step back (figuratively) and looked at what Hobo supplied
in a "plain-vanilla" site.
  
</bs>

The setup wizard choices need invite-only/email-invitation so the 
admin can set user's roles in this recipe.  There may be other
ways for the adminisrator to setup the restricted attributes of
users (specifically the user's role that only admin can change) but
I haven't tried to find them.

        hobo new DynamicMainMenu

        cd DynamicMainMenu
        
I found this permission/role implementation somewhere but I can't
find it now.  With a few mods to the original it works fine here.

        hobo g model permission_role
        hobo g resource admin::permission name:string description:string
        hobo g resource admin::role name:string description:string
        
This will populate the menu with some items.

        hobo g resource test_with_space name:string
        hobo g resource yada1  name:string
        hobo g resource yada2  name:string
        hobo g resource yada3  name:string
        hobo g resource yada4  name:string
        hobo g resource yada5  name:string
        hobo g resource yada6  name:string
        hobo g resource yada7  name:string
        hobo g resource yada8  name:string
        hobo g resource yada9  name:string
        hobo g resource yada10 name:string
        hobo g resource yada11 name:string
        hobo g resource yada12 name:string
        hobo g resource yada13 name:string
        hobo g resource yada14 name:string
        hobo g resource yada15 name:string
        hobo g resource yada16 name:string
        hobo g resource yada17 name:string
        hobo g resource yada18 name:string
        hobo g resource yada19 name:string
        hobo g resource yada20 name:string

At this point, you can start the app and see what happens when you have
a lot of menu items.  Note that the White Current tab impacts those below it.

Edit application.css

        /* Fixes the over-sized current tab */
        
        .page-header .navigation.main-nav li.current a {
          color: #222;
          background: url(../images/30-DBE1E5-FCFEF5.png) repeat-x #FCFEF5;
          border:0;
        }
        
        /* reduces size of the development-mode dryml file names */
        /* Note, this comes from a mod I made to the hobo templates */
        /* It is not necessary without my mods, but is present in the demo */
        .dryml_file
        {
          font-size: 9px;
        }

        
Refresh the page and the White current tab height returns to the default of the
other tabs and the menu behaves normally.

Now for some DRYML magic (there may be a DRYer way for some of this, but
it works for me). Create the file:

app/views/taglibs/nav_item.dryml

        <!-- 
          The extension of nav-item implements an interface to the
          Permission/Role subsystem such that a positive permission in the

          MenuItem (Use caution, the rails convention implies singular names,
          I've already been burnt using the permission "AccessStreetTypes" 
          which should have been "AccessStreetType") -->
        
        <extend tag="nav-item">
          <% body = parameters.default
             body = h(this.to_s) if body.blank?
             name ||= body.gsub(/<.*?>/, '').strip
             show_it = !(current_user.class == Guest)
            if show_it
              show_it = (name == 'Home') ||

                show_it = !(eval access).nil?
              end
            end
          -%>
          
          <% if show_it %>
            <old-nav-item merge />
          <% else %>
            <old-nav-item merge style="display:none" />

        </def>
        

Notice that I re-arranged the Yada's so they were in numeric order, not alphanumeric order.
I did this only to  be sure that we were NOT using the rapid-generated menu.


Edit application.dryml

        <include src="taglibs/auto/rapid/forms"/>
        <include src="taglibs/nav_item"/>
        <include src="taglibs/main_nav"/>
        
        <set-theme name="clean"/>
        
        
At this time, if you restart the app and refresh your browser, you
will see a very empty main menu

Now to populate the roles and permissions.

Login as the administrator (first user).  
In the DynamicMainMenu.tgz demo site, the admin email is a@a.com with 'Password'
as the password (all users of the demo site have 'Password' as their passwords).

Select the Admin link to get to the Admin sub-site.

Select the Roles tab on the menu and start adding Roles.
In the demo site they are (in descending capability order):

Administrator
Broker
Reviewer
Agent
InactiveAgent
Unassigned << note this is hard-coded in user.rb as the 6th item.

You do not have to add permissions at this time.  You do not have
to order the entries except, for now, the 6th entry is the initialization
value when users are created (I'll fix that soon, I hope).

Select the Permissions tab on the menu and start adding
menu permissions.  Note that menu permissions start with
Access and contain the SINGULAR name of the associated model.

Thus in the demo site,

AccessYada1
*
*
*
AccessYada20

map to each of the dummy model menu tabs, even though the tabs are
captioned Yada1s, ..., Yada20s.

Let's add some permissions to the roles.

Select the Roles tab on the menu and map permissions to each role as
you like.

I entered some pseudo-random associations in the demo site.

Now add some users with various roles.  Since I have not setup the email
for the demo site, you will have to look in the terminal output for the email message
and manually copy the link for the invitation acceptance, as in:

Betty Broker,

You have been invited to join Dynamic Main Menu. If you wish to accept, please click on the following link

  http://0.0.0.0:3001/users/6-betty-broker/accept_invitation?key=48607c3d25d861ca00cb5062ae6662a3afcd58bd

Thank you,

The Dynamic Main Menu team.

As soon as you issus the invitation (in the real world), edit the new user and assign appropriate roles.
If you don't, and the new user is fast enough, she will encounter the situation where her roles are unassigned
and she can't do anything.

Play with the demo site and you can see how the dynamics work.  The Broker and Reviewer both have alternate
roles as Agents so the tab immediately to the right of Home allows them to toggle to the mode displayed on the tab.

Note also that the permission system is not limited to the AccessMenuItem function.  In my large app, I have fine-grained
permissions that enable/limit each role's ability to (for example) view or modify other user's data.  The broker,
in broker mode, can edit everyone's profiles; in agent mode, she can only edit her own profile.  The permissions,
in this case are:

EditAllProfiles -- associated code: current_user.canEditAllProfiles?
EditOwnProfile  -- associated code: current_user.canEditOwnProfile?

in the absence of either of these permissions, the user can not even edit her own profile.

One of the things I tried (and failed) was an attempt to overload the <main-nav> tab
to automatically insert the <mode-nav-item/> tag after home.  If anyone can help with
this, it will make the site maintenance much easier as the main_navigation.dryml file will
not be needed and the whole dynamic mode change will "just work".
